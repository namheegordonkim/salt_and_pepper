# Embodied AI Seminar: the Salt and Pepper Demo Codebase

## Set up the environment

We have the same requirements as the copycat demo. If you already have it set up, making the new environment is optional.

```bash
conda create -y -n snp python=3.11
conda activate snp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the code

Run `enjoy_cem.py` to check that the interactive visualizer runs correctly.

```bash
python enjoy_cem.py
```
